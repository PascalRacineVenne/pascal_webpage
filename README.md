## Personal web page create with ReactJS

This project started as an exercise to practice what I had learned about React. 

### For the little story:

After gaining a lot of new knowledge during my time at Le Wagon Bootcamp, I wanted to create while learning new concepts. Basically, I wanted to face new challenges and expand my sandbox.


#### Next step is too create new accessible and human-oriented projects to share with everyone and this page!
